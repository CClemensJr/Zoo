< a field trip into the wonderful world of Object Oriented Programming

## summary
```
	The purpose of this app is to use the animal kingdom as a metaphor for object oriented programming. 
	It will include at least 5 animals that inherit and override properties and behaviors from parent abstract and virtual classes.
```

## object oriented programming in a nutshell
### inheritance
```
	Inheritance allows Base classes to send properties and behaviors down to Derived classes.

### abstraction
```
	Abstract allows Base classes to act as a template for Derived classes by providing properties and method signatures that they
	can define as they see fit. Once a Base class has been designated as abstract, it cannot be instantiated.

### polymorphism
```
	Polymorphism is the act of changing redefining those methods provided by Base abstract or concrete  classes. 
	Abstract methods have to be defined by concrete classes and are provided by abstract Base classes. Virtual methods, however, have 
	to be definined in the base class that creates and can live inside of concrete or abstract classes. As a result, Derived classes can
	choose whether or not to redefine the methods and properties.

### encapsulation
```
	Encapsulation is the concept of limiting how much access a class or method has to another method. Public classes and methods can
	be accessed by anything. Private classes and methods can only being accessed by methods in the same class. Protected relaxes protection
	just a little bit by allowing only Derived classes to access the classes and methods.
